            When talking about tacos, I consider myself very specific and particular about my selection.
            Tacos have to be tasty: good meat, soft, warm, scrumptious tortilla and the "salsa" on the side
            has to be spicy but not too much that you cannot enjoy the flavorse of the taco.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know it sounds complex, but it is an experience that requires years to master. The taste for tacos is
            an activity that not many people take seriously. There are factors that can compromise the "taco experience"
            and misslead the costumer with a bad impression or taste in this case about tacos from a specific place.
